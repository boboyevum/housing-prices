# Project Title
Exploring Cook County, Chicago, USA housing.

## Description
This project explores what can be learned from an extensive housing dataset that is embedded in a dense social context in Cook County, Illinois.

In the first part of this project, I will perform some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the data. Next, I will be adding a few new features to the dataset, while cleaning the data as well in the process.

In the second part of this project, I will specify and fit a linear model for the purpose of prediction. Finally, I will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance.

## Data
The dataset consists of over 500,000 records from Cook County, Illinois. The dataset has 61 features in total; the 62nd is `Sale Price`, which I will predict with linear regression. An explanation of each variable can be found in the included `codebook.txt` file.

The data are split into training and test sets with 204,792 and 68,264 observations, respectively.
