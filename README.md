# Exploring Cook County, Chicago, USA Housing

## Description

This project analyzes a large-scale housing dataset from Cook County, Illinois, and was completed as part of the Data 100 course at UC Berkeley.

In the first phase, I perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of the data. I also engineer new features and clean the dataset to prepare it for modeling.

In the second phase, I build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict housing sale prices. The project concludes with an error analysis and discussion of potential improvements.

## Data

The dataset contains over 500,000 housing records from Cook County, Illinois, with 61 input features and `Sale Price` as the target variable. A detailed description of the features is provided in the accompanying `codebook.txt` file.

The data are split into training (204,792 observations) and test (68,264 observations) sets for modeling purposes.
